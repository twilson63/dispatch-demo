# Posting Transactions (dispatch)

This is a vanilla html app that posts transactions to the permaweb.

We will use arconnect browser extension for our wallet and we will use arweave-js as our library to create a transaction.

Dispatch is a feature of arweave wallets to send gasless transactions to arweave.
